    Here we have one row for every unique encounter in the stg_encounter model, and
    for each encounter we have a flag (disqualified_encounter_flag) to indicte if
    the encounter is disqualified from being useful for readmission measures. We also

    has that may disqualify it from being used in readmission measures."
